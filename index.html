        <h2>Past</h2>
        <p>
            I have a rich history with gaming, starting with classics like 
            Duck Hunt on the original Nintendo and Nascar 98 on the Playstation. 
            Racing games became a favorite, thanks to my father's involvement 
            in Dirt Track racing. The turning point came when I acquired an 
            Xbox 360 and played Elder Scrolls Oblivion, which ignited my 
            passion for game development. Skyrim became another cherished 
            experience in my gaming journey.

            In high school, a broken ankle led to the introduction of World of 
            Warcraft by my Grandma, and I became instantly hooked on the 
            game, continuing to enjoy it to this day. Additionally, I have 
            played other games such as Runescape and Diablo IV and many others.
        </p>

            Now, as an adult, I remain an enthusiastic computer gamer, 
            exploring various genres while also working on my own game 
            development projects alongside my studies.
