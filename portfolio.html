                <h2>Clean Your Room</h2>
                <p> "Clean Your Room" is a game created for a school project using 
                    Unreal Engine 4.27 and blueprints, along with free assets 
                    from the marketplace. The objective of the game is to clean 
                    up objects in a room within a specific time limit.

                    In the game, there are hovering objects that the player can 
                    interact with. When the player approaches an object, they 
                    can trigger an interaction with it, treating it as a piece 
                    of clothing. This interaction mechanism allows the player 
                    to pick up the object and remove it from the room.
                    
                    At the top left corner of the screen, there is a counter 
                    that keeps track of the number of objects the player has 
                    picked up. Each time the player successfully interacts with 
                    an object, the counter increases by one, providing a score 
                    indicating the player's progress in cleaning up the room.
                    
                    To create a sense of urgency and challenge, a timer 
                    interface is implemented using the blueprint system. 
                    The timer starts at a specific value and counts down 
                    every second using a tick event. The player must clean 
                    up as many objects as possible before the time runs out.
                    
                    When the time limit expires, a new user interface appears 
                    on the screen. This interface displays options for the 
                    player, including a retry option to play the game again. 
                    This allows players to attempt to clean the room more 
                    efficiently and improve their score.
                    
                    Overall, "Clean Your Room" is a game that combines 
                    interactive object handling, scoring mechanics, and time 
                    management. It aims to engage players in a task-oriented 
                    challenge while providing a sense of accomplishment when 
                    successfully completing the cleaning task within the 
                    allotted time.

                    <h2>Personal Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game I created is an open-world wizard-themed 
                        adventure, developed using Unreal Engine 5. 
                        
                        In my game, players control a wizard character, 
                        utilizing basic movement controls with the WASD keys. 
                        The third-person camera perspective, follows the player 
                        character, providing an engaging and immersive view of the expansive 
                        open-world environment.
                        
                        The combat mechanics currently feature the use of a 
                        staff to attack enemies, but my plans to introduce a 
                        spell system will become available later on.
                                                                       
                        As I continue to develop my game, 
                        flexibility and expandability will support my plans to 
                        incorporate a quest system, character progression, and 
                        the final boss encounter. The engine's blueprint system 
                        allows for easy iteration and modification of game 
                        mechanics, empowering you to create engaging quests and 
                        meaningful player progression.
                        
                        My open-world wizard adventure game comes to life with 
                        stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and the potential 
                        for exciting future expansions.
